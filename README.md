# Sveltekit-KQL

> **Warning:** This library is still a work in progress which means lots and lots of bugs and breaking changes. Use at your own risk.

Sveltekit-KQL is a library that allows you to use KQL (Kirby Query Language) for [kirby cms](https://getkirby.com/) CMS in your SvelteKit project. This library provides a wrapper for [load functions](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/load) in SvelteKit.

The type system that i am implementing here in order to resolve Kirby Query Language queries is heavily inspired (and based on) from the works of [johanschopplich](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-types) and [benwest](https://github.com/benwest/kql-ts)
